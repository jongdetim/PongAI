- refactor to oop
- decouple tickrate and fps
- increase ticketrate to resolve the ball jumping over the paddle at higher speeds.

^^^____DONE____^^^

- even with at 300 game logic update per second, the ball jumps over the paddle at higher speeds.
        -> implement continuous collision checking between balls and paddle.

- angular paddle bounce-off
- implement genetic algorithm AI
- implement reinforcement learning AI
- extra: implement NEAT AI
